Problem Statement
Diagnosing brain tumors is challenging due to delayed detection, high imaging costs, and manual interpretation errors. These issues lead to inconsistent diagnoses and delayed treatment.

CNN Model
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed to analyze brain MRI scans, extracting features to detect and classify tumors efficiently. The model automates tumor identification, ensuring accuracy and reducing diagnostic time.

Flask Integration
The Flask-based website allows users to upload MRI images, which are processed by the CNN model. The platform predicts and displays the tumor classification output in real-time, offering a simple and effective diagnostic solution.
